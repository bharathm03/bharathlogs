Recently I found out that we don't need to install any external app for taking a precise screenshot using the PrintScreen(PrtScn) button. There is an app called "Snip & Sketch" installed in every Windows 10 PC. Follow the procedure below to enable this feature.
1. Open the Windows Start menu.
2. Search for "Snip & Sketch" app.
3. Open settings window using [ . . . ] more options menu.
4. Click the link given for "Print Screen Shortcut". Note: It also has multiple snip options that you can explore.
5. It will ask for confirmation about app switch and press "Yes".
6. It will open the system's default Keyboard settings window.
7. Now the scroll the window and check for "Print Screen" switch button.
8. Then turn it on.
9. Now are all set for simplest screen printing.

Happy snipping.
